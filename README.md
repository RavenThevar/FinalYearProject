Abstract

Credit scoring is one of the most critical aspect in a financial institutions or 
banks as it supports the financial decision-making processes. It basically uses 
applicantsâ€™ historical data and statistical or machine learning techniques to assess 
the risk associated with an applicant. According to Soui et al. (2019), high quality risk 
management allows banks to build a robust decision-making system and to reduce 
losses. Soui et al. (2019) had also mentioned that banking risks are composed of 
three types of risks such as credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Out of the 
three risks, credit risk represents 60 % of the overall threat for banks (Soui et al. 
2019). Hence, to address this, financial institutions commonly uses a credit scoring 
model to examine and foresee the probability of a borrower defaulting on a current 
credit item (Chen et al. 2020). Armaki et al. (2017) had mentioned that it is important 
to notice that even a 1 % enhancement on the accuracy of the credit scoring system 
will significantly increase the profits of banks and other financial institutions. 
Therefore, this paper is being researched to address the two lowest accurate 
classification techniques used in a credit scoring application on a German credit data 
set, and to implement ensemble algorithm which is Stacking on them to indicate if 
Stacking can improve the overall accuracy of the two lowest credit scoring models
which are k-Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree. The proposed Stacking method 
had successfully improved the accuracy of the k-Nearest Neighbour and Decision 
Tree. The Decision Tree ensemble model (stacking) at an accuracy of 0.738 and the 
k-Neareast Neighbours ensemble model (stacking) at an accuracy of 0.733 has 
improved the accuracy of the two lowest individually developed models which are k-Nearest Neighbours at 0.71175 & Decision Tree at 0.71025 before using 10-fold, 
Repeated Cross-Validation technique and also k-Nearest Neighbours at 0.684 &
Decision Tree at 0.731 after using 10-fold, Repeated Cross-Validation technique.
Stacking is proven to be suitable for ensemble applications involving other base 
classifiers. This study has successfully showed that the Stacking is a good ensemble 
method and can be considered by financial institutions to improve their existing base 
classifier models.
